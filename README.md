# Self hosted Gnosis Safe

An effort to self-host Gnosis Safe ourselves on a doomsday-like scenario.

# Background

In short, Gnosis Safe relies in a series of [centralized services](https://docs.gnosis.io/safe/docs/services_relay/)
to provide the great UX it currently has. Unfortunately, as any centralized provider, it can go down and make everyone
unhappy that their DAO can not buy the latest stoner cat or whatever the kids are doing nowadays.

So instead of tweeting about Gnosis Safe being done (we are [guilty](https://twitter.com/paulkhls/status/1420798041934663681?s=20) of have doing so), we put together this stack that quickly spins your own Gnosis Safe for you
to use.
